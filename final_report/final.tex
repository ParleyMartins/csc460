\section{Game Agent}

The first dumb agent (SimpleCycleAgent) is just a simple cycle made to beat the Rock, Paper, Scissors. It doesn't react to the other agent and always play this cycle.

The second agent (BiggerCycleAgent) is another dumb cycle, but bigger. It chooses a random cycle size from 1000 to 10000 and randomly populates the cycle. Once it's done, it just iterates through the cycle, without any reaction.

The third agent (StatisticAgent) is ``smarter'', in the sense that it reacts to the other player. It counts the frequency of a movement and plays the action that would beat the most played action by the oponent.
